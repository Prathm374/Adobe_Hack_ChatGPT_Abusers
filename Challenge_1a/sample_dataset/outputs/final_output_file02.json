Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions \nThis overview document is intended for anyone with an interest in the ISTQB Foundation Level \nExtensions who wants a high-level introduction to the leading principles and an overview of the individual \nextension syllabi. \nFrom time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be \nintroduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the \nupdated document will be available on the ISTQB website. \nThe ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for \nsome time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often \nare brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the \nExpert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the \nISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and \nintroduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but \nthat is beyond the scope of this document. \nThe following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released: \n \nAgile Tester \nIn this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business \nOutcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who \nachieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and \nwill outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this \nlevel. \nVersion 2014 \nPage 6 of 12 \nMay 31, 2014 \n© International Software Testing Qualifications Board"

Introduction to Foundation Level Agile Tester Extension \nThe certification for Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester is designed for professionals who are \nworking within Agile environments. It is also for professionals who are planning to start implementing \nAgile methods in the near future, or are working within companies that plan to do so, The certification \nprovides an advantage for those who would like to know the required Agile activities, roles, methods, and \nmethodologies specific to their role. \n2.1 Intended Audience \nThe Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester qualification is aimed at four main groups of professionals: \n1. Professionals who have achieved in-depth testing experience in traditional methods and would \nlike to get an Agile Tester Certificate. \n2. Junior professional testers who are just starting in the testing profession, have received the \nFoundation Level certificate, and would like to know more about the tester’s role in an Agile \nenvironment. \n3. Professionals who are relatively new to testing and are required to implement test approaches, \nmethods and techniques in their day to day job in Agile projects. \n4. Professionals who are experienced in their role (including unit testing) and need more \nunderstanding and knowledge about how to perform and manage testing on all levels in Agile \nprojects. \nThese professionals include people who are in roles such as testers, test analysts, test engineers, test \nconsultants, test managers, user acceptance testers, and software developers. \nThis Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester certification may also be appropriate for anyone who \nwants a deeper understanding of software testing in the Agile world, such as project managers, quality \nmanagers, software development managers, business analysts, IT directors, and management \nconsultants. \n2.2 Career Paths for Testers \nBuilding on the Foundation Level, the Agile Tester Extension supports the definition of career paths for \nprofessional testers. A person with the Agile Tester certificate has extended the broad understanding of \ntesting acquired at the Foundation Level to enable him or her to work effectively as a professional tester in \nan Agile project.  \nPeople possessing an ISTQB Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester certificate may use the Certified \nTester Foundation Level acronym CTFL-AT. \n2.3 Learning Objectives \nIn general, the Foundation Level syllabus is examinable at a K1 level, i.e., the candidate will recognize, \nremember and recall terms and concepts stated in the Foundation Level syllabus. \nIn addition, all Foundation Level syllabus learning objectives are examinable at the same K- level in an \nextension exam. \nVersion 2014 \nPage 7 of 12 \nMay 31, 2014 \n© International Software Testing Qualifications Board"
